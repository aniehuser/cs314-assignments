      <div class="special-header color1-bg"><h3>Marker 1: Home</h3></div>
      <p>This is the place I grew up. Growing up I only ever knew Portland. My family didn't travel much, and I never left the country until I went to college. As a result, I grew to know this town fairly well.</p>

      <div class="special-header color2-bg"><h3>Marker 2: Jesuit High School</h3></div>
      <p>Jesuit High School in Beaverton, Oregon was where I spent those four infamous years of high school at. Coming from a very large public middle school, this private, Catholic institution gave me a bit of a culture shock, but I think I adjusted well, and learned a lot from some truly amazing teachers.</p>

      <div class="special-header color3-bg"><h3>Marker 3: Stepping Stone Cafe</h3></div>
      <p>If you know me at all, you'd be familiar with my obsession over pancakes. I love pancakes so much I refuse to eat anything other than buttermilk pancakes, and never with syrup -- it masks the taste of the cake! Stepping Stone Cafe has some of the largest, tastiest pancakes Portland has to offer. Their Mancakes are colossal. Many a good mornings were spent here once I got my driver's license.</p>
